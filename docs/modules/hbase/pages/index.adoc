= Stackable Operator for Apache HBase
:description: The Stackable Operator for Apache HBase is a Kubernetes operator that can manage Apache HBase clusters. Learn about its features, resources, dependencies, and demos, and see the list of supported HBase versions.

This is an Operator for Kubernetes that manages https://hbase.apache.org/[Apache HBase] clusters.
Apache HBase is an open-source, distributed, non-relational database that runs on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

== Getting started

Follow the xref:getting_started/index.adoc[] guide to learn how to xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[install] the Stackable Operator for Apache HBase as well as the dependencies. The Guide will also show you how to xref:getting_started/first_steps.adoc[interact] with HBase running on Kubernetes by creating tables and some data using the REST API or Apache Phoenix. 

The xref:usage-guide/index.adoc[] contains more information on xref:usage-guide/phoenix.adoc[] as well as other topics such as xref:usage-guide/resource-requests.adoc[CPU and memory configuration], xref:usage-guide/monitoring.adoc[] and xref:usage-guide/logging.adoc[].

== Operator model

The Operator manages the _HbaseCluster_ custom resource. You configure your HBase instance using this resource, and the Operator creates Kubernetes resources such as StatefulSets, ConfigMaps and Services accordingly.

HBase uses three xref:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[roles]: `masters`, `regionServers` and `restServers`.

For every RoleGroup a **StatefulSet** is created. Each StatefulSet can contain multiple replicas (Pods).
For every RoleGroup a **Service** is created, as well as one for the whole cluster that references the `regionServers`.
For every Role and RoleGroup the Operator creates a **Service**.

A **ConfigMap** is created for each RoleGroup containing 3 files: `hbase-env.sh` and `hbase-site.xml` files generated from the HbaseCluster configuration (See xref:usage-guide/index.adoc[] for more information), plus a `log4j.properties` file used for xref:usage-guide/logging.adoc[].
The Operator creates a **xref:usage-guide/discovery.adoc[discovery ConfigMap]** for the whole HbaseCluster a which contains information on how to connect to the HBase cluster.

== Dependencies

A distributed Apache HBase installation depends on a running Apache ZooKeeper and HDFS cluster. See the documentation for the xref:hdfs:index.adoc[Stackable Operator for Apache HDFS] how to set up these clusters.

== Demo

The xref:stackablectl::demos/hbase-hdfs-load-cycling-data.adoc[] demo shows how you can use HBase together with HDFS.

== Supported Versions

The Stackable Operator for Apache HBase currently supports the following versions of Apache HBase:
