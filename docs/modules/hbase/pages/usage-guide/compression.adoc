:description: Stackable HBase supports GZip and Snappy compression. Learn to enable and use compression for column families via HBase Shell commands.

Stackable images of Apache HBase support compressed column families.
The following compression algorithms are supported for all HBase 2.4 versions:

* GZip
* Snappy

Later versions of HBase might support a different set of compression algorithms.

See the {hbase-docs-compression}[HBase documentation] for the details on how to enable compression for specific column families.

Here is one example on how to use the HBase Shell to create a table with a single column family that uses the Snappy algorithm for compression:

hbase:014:0> create 'COMPRESSION_TEST', {NAME => 'cf1', COMPRESSION => 'SNAPPY'}
Created table COMPRESSION_TEST

hbase:015:0> put 'COMPRESSION_TEST', 'row_XYZ', 'cf1', 'abc123'

hbase:016:0> scan 'COMPRESSION_TEST'
