= Compression support

Our images of Apache HBase support compressed column families.
We support the following compression algorithms for all HBase 2.4 versions:

- GZip
- Snappy

Later versions of HBase might support a different set of compression algorithms.

See the https://hbase.apache.org/book.html#changing.compression[HBase documentation] for the details on how to enable compression for specific column families.

Here is one example on how to use the HBase Shell to create a table with a single column family that uses the Snappy algorithm for compression:

----
hbase:014:0> create 'COMPRESSION_TEST', {NAME => 'cf1', COMPRESSION => 'SNAPPY'}
Created table COMPRESSION_TEST
Took 1.1206 seconds
=> Hbase::Table - COMPRESSION_TEST
hbase:015:0> put 'COMPRESSION_TEST', 'row_XYZ', 'cf1', 'abc123'
Took 0.0087 seconds
hbase:016:0> scan 'COMPRESSION_TEST'
ROW                                           COLUMN+CELL
 row_XYZ                                      column=cf1:, timestamp=2023-10-20T10:46:03.509, value=abc123
1 row(s)
