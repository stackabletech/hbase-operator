= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the permitted Pod disruptions for HBase nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable our PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), the default PDBs are configured as follows:

== Master
Only a single Master is allowed to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== RegionServer
Only a single RegionServer is allowed to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`, to have as little data unavailable as possible at any given time.

== RestServer
Only a single RestServer is allowed to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.
