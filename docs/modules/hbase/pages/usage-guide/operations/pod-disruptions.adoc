= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the allowed Pod disruptions for HBase nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable our PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), we write the following PDBs:

== Master
We only allow a single Master to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== RegionServer
We only allow a single RegionServer to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`, to have as little data unavailable as possible at any given time.

== RestServer
We only allow a single RestServer to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.
