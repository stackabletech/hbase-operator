= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

Apache HBase offers an API. The Operator deploys a service called `<name>` (where `<name>` is the name of the HbaseCluster) through which HBase can be reached.

This service can have either the `cluster-internal` or `external-unstable` type. `external-stable` is not supported for HBase at the moment. Read more about the types in the xref:concepts:service-exposition.adoc[service exposition] documentation at platform level.

This is how the listener class is configured:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: cluster-internal  # <1>
----
<1> The default `cluster-internal` setting.
