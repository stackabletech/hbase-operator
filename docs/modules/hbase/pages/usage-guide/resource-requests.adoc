= Resource requests

include::concepts:stackable_resource_requests.adoc[]

If no resources are configured explicitly, the HBase operator uses following defaults:

[source,yaml]
----
regionServers:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          cpu:
            min: '200m'
            max: "4"
          memory:
            limit: '2Gi'
----

WARNING: The default values are _most likely_ not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements.
