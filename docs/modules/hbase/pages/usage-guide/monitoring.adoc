= Monitoring

The managed HBase instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics.
See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

Starting with HBase 2.6 the URL for Prometheus metrics has changed.
This is because HBase offers now a built-in endpoint for this purpose.
This endpoint is available from the UI service.
For example, in the case of the master service, the URL is `http://<master-service>:16010/prometheus`.
The old URL `http://<master-service>:9100` is still available for HBase 2.4.
