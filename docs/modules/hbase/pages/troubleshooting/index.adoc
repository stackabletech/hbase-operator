== HBase access with Kerberos authentication

Currently, xref:zookeeper:index.adoc[Zookeeper] stacklets can only be secured using mutual TLS.
This means, if an application tries to connect to HBase, it would contact Zookeeper to figure the correct HBase nodes to talk to.
In a Java world, you would define a `Client` which would carry the Kerberos requirements.

However, those requirements might be passed through and thus your client (e.g. xref:spark-k8s:usage-guide:operations:applications.adoc[SparkApplications]) would try to authenticate with Kerberos at the corresponding Zookeeper endpoint.
This will result in a Kerberos ( authentication ) error.

To prevent this, you can set a xref:concepts:overrides.adoc#jvm-argument-overrides[JVM argument] like this (again e.g. SparkApplications) in all Pods which would like to talk to HBase:

[source,yaml]
----
jvmArgumentOverrides:
  add:
    - "-Dzookeeper.sasl.client=false"
----
