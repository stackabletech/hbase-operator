== Hbase access with kerberos authentication

Currently, xref:zookeeper:index.adoc[Zookeeper] is not secured with authentication. This means, if an application tries to connect to Hbase, it would ask the zookeeper quorum to figure the correct nodes to talk to. In a Java world, you would define a `Client` which would carry the kerberos requirements.

However, those requirements might be passed through and thus your client ( e.g. xref:spark-k8s:usage-guide:operations:applications.adoc[SparkApplications] ) would try to authenticate with kerberos at the corresponding Zookeeper endpoint. This will result in a kerberos ( authentication ) error.

To prevent this, you can set a jvm argument like ( again e.g. SparkApplications )

[source,yaml]
----
jvmArgumentOverrides:
    add:
        - "-Dzookeeper.sasl.client=false"
----

in all pods which would like to talk to Hbase.
