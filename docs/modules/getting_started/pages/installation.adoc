= Installation

On this page you will install the Stackable HBase operator and its dependencies, the ZooKeeper and HDFS operators, as well as the commons and secret operators which are required by all Stackable operators.

== Stackable Operators

There are 2 ways to run Stackable operators

1. Using xref:stackablectl::index.adoc[]

1. Using Helm

=== stackablectl

stackablectl is the command line tool to interact with Stackable operators and our recommended way to install operators.
Follow the xref:stackablectl::installation.adoc[installation steps] for your platform.

After you have installed stackablectl run the following command to install all operators necessary for the HBase cluster:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=stackablectl-install-operators]
----

The tool will show

[source]
include::example$code/install_output.txt[]


TIP: Consult the xref:stackablectl::quickstart.adoc[] to learn more about how to use stackablectl. For example, you can use the `-k` flag to create a Kubernetes cluster with link:https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind].

=== Helm

You can also use Helm to install the operators. Add the Stackable Helm repository:
[source,bash]
----
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-add-repo]
----

Then install the Stackable Operators:
[source,bash]
----
include::example$code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-install-operators]
----

Helm will deploy the operators in a Kubernetes Deployment and apply the CRDs for the HBase cluster (as well as the CRDs for the required operators). You are now ready to deploy HBase in Kubernetes.
