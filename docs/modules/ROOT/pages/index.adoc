= Stackable Operator for Apache HBase

This is an operator for Kubernetes that can manage https://https://hbase.apache.org/[Apache HBase] clusters.

WARNING: This operator does _not_ work with containers/container images. It relies on the https://github.com/stackabletech/agent/[Stackable Agent] to run on "bare metal" via systemd.
